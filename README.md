Software-as-a-service (SaaS) is a form of cloud computing that delivers a cloud application—and all its underlying IT infrastructure and platforms—to end users through an internet browser. It can be an ideal solution for large enterprises, small businesses or individuals that:

    Do not want the responsibility of buying or maintaining infrastructure, platforms, and on-premises software.
    Prefers simpler cost management through operational expenses (OPEX), rather than capital expense investments (CAPEX).
    Have challenges that require minimal customization to solve.
    Favor software subscription models.
