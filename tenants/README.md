# Multi-tenant vs. Single-tenant

Multitenant architecture, in computing refers to multiple customers using shared computing resources. 
However, although they share resources, the data of cloud customers is kept totally separate, and they arenâ€™t aware of each other.

## Advantages of Single Tenant Architecture

- Security.
- Reliability.
- Easier Backup and Restoration.
- Individual Upgrades.
- Easier Migration. 

## Drawbacks of Single Tenant Environments

- Cost.
- Maintenance.
- Efficiency. 


## Advantages of Multi-Tenant Architecture

- Lower Costs.
- Efficient Resources.
- Lower Maintenance Costs and Fewer User Responsibilities.
- Common Data Centers.
- Increased Computing Capacity.
- Simplified Data Mining.
- Streamlined Data Release and Installation.

## Drawbacks of Multi-Tenant Cloud Architecture

- Downtime.
- Security and Compliance.
- Noisy Neighbors.
