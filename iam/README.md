# Identity and Access Management

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a discipline of cyber-security that enables an organization to set up rights, access control, privileges, and manage identities etc.

IAM solutions are leveraged by employees (employee identity management) of an organization and customers (customer identity management) leveraging their products/services.

IAM systems enable IT managers to monitor & ensure their employees & users like who is authenticating and how they are accessing the applications.

Apart from implementing identity management & access control, IAM systems also support various authentication methods such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), two-factor authentication (2FA), single sign-on (SSO), smart log-in, password less authentication, etc.

IAMâ€™s core components include:
 - A database containing user-related information, digital identities, and access-privileges
 - Diverse security and IAM programs/tools
 - A proper operation in arrangement for auditing and accessing history/logs within the system
